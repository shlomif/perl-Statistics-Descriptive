        lib/Statistics/Descriptive/Smoother/Exponential.pm
        lib/Statistics/Descriptive/Smoother/Weightedexponential.pm
        modules.

3.0400      2012-03-01
    - Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74890
        - some function should return undef() in list context so they can
        be easily assigned to values in hash initialisations.
        - thanks to SLAFFAN for a preliminary patch which was modified
        by SHLOMIF (the current Statistics-Descriptive maintainer).

3.0300      2012-02-11
    - Now mean() and median() and other routines return undef() if there are
    no data.
    - Somewhat incompatible change: some methods that returned undef() under
    list context now return an empty list (so it will be false).
        - it is generally not recommended to call such methods in list context
        as they should always be called in scalar context.
    - Resolves https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74693
        - thanks to Shawn Laffan for the report and the patch.

3.0203      2011-11-17
    - Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72495 .
        - percentile should not die and should return undef if there are
        no elements in the collection.

3.0202      2011-07-23
    - Moved tag-release.pl to scripts/tag-release.pl (though we now use
    Mercurial instead of Subversion.)
    - Add t/mode.t to test the ->mode() method.
    - Documented ->mode() better.
    - Optimized ->mode().

3.0201      2010-10-14
    - Add some documentation clarifying the 0th percentile return, as it
    returns undef() for representing -inf:
        - Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62055
        - Thanks to Dave Breimann for reporting it.
    - Add the tag-release.pl to tag a release using Subversion.

3.0200      2010-06-18
    - Added skewness and kurtosis
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58187
        - Thanks to Shawn Laffan.
    - Removed the Changes / Revision log from the .pm file.

3.0102      2010-06-15
    - Add the $VERSION variable to Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse and
    Statistics::Descriptive::Full. This was done to silence the CPAN indexer.

3.0101      2010-06-15
    - Moved the trimmed_mean caching test (that used the Benchmark.pm module)
    to rejects/descr.t , because it kept failing.

3.0100      2009-07-20
    - Added the quantile method - thanks to Djibril Ousmanou (DJIBEL).
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47948

3.0000      2009-05-29
    - Added tests (for ->count, ->sum, ->sumsq, ->min, ->max)
    - Localized the scope of $stat and other variables in t/descr.t
    - Got rid of AUTOLOAD in favour of individual accessors.
    - Converted many direct member accesses to the accessors.
    - Added ->frequency_distribution_ref() which deprecates
      frequency_distribution().
    - Some refactoring of the lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm module
    (without breaking the documented API).

2.9         2009-05-13

    - Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46026 :
        - standard_deviation failing due to a variance that got evaluated
        to 0 due to rounding errors.
    - Kwalitee : added a LICENSE section to the POD.
    - Kwalitee (CPANTS) : added an examples/ directory with a script.

2.8         2009-05-09

    - Enabled "./Build runtest" and "./Build distruntest" (using Test::Run)
    in the distribution.

    - Fixed incomplete/broken tests in t/descr.t.

2.7         2009-05-03

    - Converted the distribution to Build.PL and re-organized it to
    put everything under its proper place. Started maintaining it in:
        - [Old SVN Repository] - URL Elided.

    - Converted t/descr.t to use "use strict;" and "use warnings;".

    - Converted t/descr.t to use Test::More.

    - Cleaned up the "use" statement of lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm.

    - Added more explicit dependencies (core, though) to Build.PL.

    - Fixed RT bug #34999: freq distribution generated too many bins.
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34999

    - Added some keywords and resources to the META.yml, using Build.PL's
    meta_merge.

    - Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32183
        - more authoritative (and non-broken) link to the RFC.

    - Applied the patch in https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9160
        - {{#9160: Variance and Standard Deviation use costly pseudo-variance,
        instead of computing real variance}}.

2.6         2002-10-10
    - Fixed caching in trimmed mean and modified code to allow trimming
      0% from upper bound.  Formerly if 0 was requested then it used the
      lower bound!

    - POD format patch from ddunlap

2.5         1999-05-12
    - Forgot to document change in v2.4, which included fixing
      percentile so that it worked right and added to the test
      harness.
    - Modified frequency_distribution so that specific bins could
      be passed in.  Fixed caching so that it actually works
      (it only used to get stuck returning the result of the
      first call).
    - Turned off caching for least_squares_fit because there's no
      way to generate a unique key for memorization.

2.3         1998-11-12
    - Fix for frequency distribution.
      Changed Makefile.PL to ease ActiveState distribution of the module.
      Andrea's code for preventing division by zero and other
      improvements.  He also wrote a great test bench.
      Added code from Warren Matthews to calculate percentile.

2.2         1998-02-23
    - Multiple bug fixes:
      Fixed min/max bug with '0' vs defined.
      Provided fix for bug with AUTOLOAD/DESTROY/Carp problem.

2.1         1997-09-02
    - Multiple bug fixes:
      Cleaned up syntax error with my scoping.
      Fixed errors in least_squares_fit and median methods

2.00        1997-08-20
    - new version; created by h2xs 1.16
    - Complete rewrite of OO interface by Colin Kuskie.
    - Now has 2 classes instead of 1.5, a base class without data
      storage and a class that inherits the base methods and
      extends them with data storage and more statistics.

1.1         1995-04-01
        - Added LeastSquaresFit and FrequencyDistribution.

1.0         1995-03-01
        - Released to comp.lang.perl and placed on archive sites.

0.20        1994-12-01
        - Complete rewrite after extensive and invaluable e-mail
          correspondence with Anno Siegel.

0.10        1994-12-01
        - Initital concept, released to perl5-porters list.
    - Jason Kastner <jkastner@tuba.aix.calpoly.edu>
